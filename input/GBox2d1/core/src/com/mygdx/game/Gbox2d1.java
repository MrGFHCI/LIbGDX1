// Got this from:
//https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/box2d#initialization
// It did not tell me where to put the code, so I went to my laptop project - similar, but it worked - but I did not understand it. Let's mergee the two.
// the one that worked was from:
// I got this example from http://programmersweb.blogspot.ca/2012/07/simple-libgdx-box2d-bouncing-ball.html
// I had to update "GL10" to "GL20" - that's it.

// It works: Gbox2d1: the circle falls down - right through the floor. Now I will get it to bounce like the laptop code.
// when I add the ground definition, it crashes in the ugliest way.  I will comment the area, and then give it a rest.

// now that the ground is created after the camera, there is no problem. The ball stops at the ground. Now let's make it bounce.
